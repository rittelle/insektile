# How to test

1. To enable debug output, `KWin Scripting` needs to be changed inside KDebugSettings.
2. KWin can be restarted from a console with `kwin_x11 --replace`, the debug output is now printed here
3. Install/update the package using `plasmapkg2 -i .`/`plasmapkg2 -u .`
4. Restart the script inside the KDE System Settings

After changing and updating the script KWin needs to be restarted, probably a bug in KWin.
